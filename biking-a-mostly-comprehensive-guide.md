# üö≤ Biking - a mostly comprehensive guide

## General (unwritten) rules:

* ‚Äúuitgezonderd‚Äù = ‚Äúexcepted‚Äù. If you see a do not enter/wrong way sign, but it says ‚Äúuitgezondered fiets‚Äù underneath, you are allowed to bike down it anyway.
* Bike paths are usually delineated by red/maroon pavement or bricks, either as a small lane in the street or a dedicated path separate from the road. They may be other colors too, or just plain, but it should be fairly obvious where they are. If you do not see one, it is very likely you are on the wrong street and there is a parallel bike-friendly street nearby.&#x20;
* Do not cycle on sidewalks unless there is no other option!
* Do not cycle on the wrong side of a 2-way cycle path or the wrong way down a one-way road when not excepted!
* Do not cycle in the middle of the street when a cycle path exists! (this is legally enforced!)
* When turning, especially if there are other bikers behind you, make sure to signal your turn by holding out a hand in the direction you‚Äôre turning. For example, if turning left, extend your left hand outward (or bend your right arm 90 degrees upwards). For turning right just reverse this.
* When biking near tram tracks, make sure to go across them at an angle, especially with thin wheels. If you don‚Äôt, your wheel may fall into the track and you‚Äôll fall off your bike. You‚Äôll also look really dumb.
* Always stay to the right. On streets with a one-way cycle path on each side, use the one on the right whenever convenient (you can use the one on the left if the right side is a major detour)
  * When on a path, also keep to the right of your lane. There is always someone who wants to overtake you, slowpoke.
* During the night and poor visibility (i.e. fog/stormy weather), you are legally required to have a front (white) and rear (red) light on and working additionally you legally need a functioning bell. You can be pulled over for this. Ask me how I know.
* DO NOT TOUCH YOUR PHONE!!!! You may use your phone for navigation, but you cannot interact with it at all while moving. You will get fined up the ass (100 euro) if caught!
  * Listening to music with headphones, while potentially dangerous, is allowed while riding your bike. Use the transparency mode on your headphones if it has it.
* If you see ‚Äúshark‚Äôs teeth‚Äù on the ground pointing towards you, that means you must give way to approaching bike/car traffic.
  * Making eye contact with drivers is a great way to make them stop
  * You must always give way to pedestrians in the path. Feel free to ring your bell at them repeatedly though. Go to the area near Amsterdam Centraal Station if you want to practice this. There are lots of clueless tourists who have no idea what a bike path is.
* For people on a budget, your two options for buying/renting a bike are:
  * Swapfiets - Cheap and reliable long-term bike rental. Covers insurance, repairs, etc.
  * Tweedehands - 2nd hand bikes. Find them on Marktplaats or most bike stores.
* Lock your bike!!! Bikes in the Netherlands almost always have a ring lock (located below the chair. Turn the key, push the lever down, un-turn the key, and remove it to lock. To unlock, just insert and turn the key and the lever should snap back up. If it doesn‚Äôt, give it a little push and it usually pops up) and a chain lock (either integrated into the ring lock or as a separate lock/key). Use both locks when in sketchy areas. Make sure to put the chain through the bike frame, at least one wheel, and something attached to the ground.
*   Bike parking is widely available, although in busy areas it may be hard to find an available space. Nice parking is found at places marked ‚Äúfietsenstalling‚Äù, where there is usually a guard and 2-level racks. At many of these parking places, you must scan a bank card or OV-chipkaart to gain access. In automated parking areas, you may encounter gates like this:

    * Bike parking is almost always free for 24 hours, with an hourly/daily rate thereafter. Be aware of this!

* OV-fiets bike rental is available at many NS stations for last-mile journeys, i.e. to get from the station to a business. You must load an OV-fiets subscription (which is free) onto your personal OV-chipkaart (see the Public Transport section) to access them. They cost a flat fare per 24 hours.
* Taking your bike onto the trains and metro is only allowed during off-peak hours, weekends, and public holidays, and you must pay an extra fee at ticket machines. Taking your bike on the buses and trams is not allowed (just bike, lazy fuck)
* Taking a folding bicycle onto public transport of any type is allowed.
