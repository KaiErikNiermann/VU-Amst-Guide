If you feel like something should be added you have two options, either talk with some of the mods on [the discord](https://discord.gg/MGG72qsKrn) and we will add something, or you can add to the page via the [public GitHub Repository](https://github.com/KaiErikNiermann/VU-Amst-Guide).&#x20;

If you choose to add via the GitHub then please fork the repository, make a new branch and submit a Pull Request. If you do not know how to do this there are some great resources online, and you will most likely learn throughout the cs bachelor anyways.
