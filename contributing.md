# ðŸ–¥ Contributing

If you feel like something should be added you have a few options,&#x20;

* contact me ( #appulsauce ) on [the discord](https://discord.gg/MGG72qsKrn) and I can either invite you and you can add something or you can send me something to add &#x20;
* you can add to the page via the [public GitHub Repository](https://github.com/KaiErikNiermann/VU-Amst-Guide).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you choose to add via the GitHub then please fork the repository, make a new branch and submit a Pull Request. If you do not know how to do this there are some great resources online, and you will most likely learn throughout the cs bachelor anyways.
