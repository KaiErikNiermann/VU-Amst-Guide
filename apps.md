# ðŸ“± Apps

### Public Transport

**NS** for train travel. Generally not a good idea to use this for local public transport.

**GVB** for tram, bus, and metro travel in Amsterdam only.

**9292** for all public transport that uses OV-chipkaart/OVpay, e.g. trains, trams, bus, ferry.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is generally not a good idea to use Google/Apple Maps for public transport, as these services are not directly tied to the public transport companies and therefore may give outdated or inaccurate information. See the Public Transport section for more info.
{% endhint %}

***

### Biking

**Fietsersbond Routeplanner** for vastly improved bicycle directions compared to Google Maps. The app is only available in Dutch, but can be figured out using common sense.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure to follow the biking laws! See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-cYZo5kToM) regarding signs, as well as following the advice in the Biking section!
{% endhint %}

### Food Delivery

**Uber Eats / Thuisbezorgd / Deliveroo** for ordering food.

{% hint style="info" %}
Alot of times restraurants have their own websites where ordering from is generally cheaper than Uber Eats and often gives you benefits. So make sure to lookup where you wanna order from online before you use an app.
{% endhint %}

### Food Pickup

**Too Good To Go (TGTG)**

{% hint style="info" %}
You can get alot of really cheap good stuff from here. You just reserve it on the app then show your phone at the counter when you arrive. Highly recommended !
{% endhint %}

***

### Payment

**PayPal** for payment, especially good for online stuff. Purchases using iDeal will be handled via your bankâ€™s mobile app.

**Revolut / Bunq** for payment and crypto. You can also get a credit & debit card via Revolut if registered in NL.

{% hint style="info" %}
I don't believe Revolut gives you an actual Dutch IBAN which is sometimes necessary, so I would recommend Bunq over Revolut but both services have thier own use case and pros and cons, so my personal recommendation is just to have both.
{% endhint %}

***

### Weather

**Buienradar and Buienalarm** are hyperlocal weather apps.

***

### Student Resources

**Canvas Student** to check your canvas information.

***

### Grocery Delivery

**Gorillas / Getir / Flink / Picnic** for grocery delivery.

{% hint style="warning" %}
These apps often charge a considerable markup over just regular grocery stores, so just keep that in mind.&#x20;

Though Picnic is definitely the cheaper one of the bunch and better for larger orders that you don't immediately need. Whereas the other 3 are better for smaller quicker orders.
{% endhint %}

***

### Taxi Services

**Uber / Bolt** for taxi services.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Generally not advisable due to high cost and reliable public transport, except during late night hours from 1-5 AM, but always check if a night bus is available.
{% endhint %}

***

### Government Services

**DigiD** is a government digital identity, tied to your BSN (Burger Service Nummer).&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is required to log in to certain government services as well as health insurance websites.
{% endhint %}
