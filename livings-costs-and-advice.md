## Groceries

### Albert Heijn&#x20;

This is one of the most expensive grocery stores. If you want to checkout the prices of goods they have a [website](https://www.ah.nl/). Unless you specifically like something in AH or you have the money to afford the markup it wouldn't really be a top recommendation.

#### Bonus Card

If you do decide to go to AH its highly recommended that you get a bonus card, to avoid carrying around added stuff you can just download the app and get a digital card, you can then just scan the barcode on the app on checkout and you can sometimes get discounts on certain items. In the app also checkout the Bonus Box, this is a selection of items which you can apply a minor discount to if you scan with the Bonus Card.

### WhatsApp groups

One very easy way to get Furniture is to see if there is a group chat for the place you are living. Very often people moving out want to get rid of their furniture and will often sell it for extremely cheap or even just give it away since people rarely take it with them when moving, so its a great opportunity to snag really cheap furniture items.
