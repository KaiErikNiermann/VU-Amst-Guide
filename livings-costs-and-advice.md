## Groceries

### Albert Heijn&#x20;

This is one of the most expensive grocery stores. If you want to checkout the prices of goods they have a [website](https://www.ah.nl/). Unless you specifically like something in AH or you have the money to afford the markup it wouldn't really be a top recommendation.

[App for android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icemobile.albertheijn\&hl=nl\&pli=1)

[App for apple](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/albert-heijn-supermarkt/id327535329)

{% hint style="danger" %}
**BE AWARE OF AH TOGO MARKUP**, they often times have a 25 - 50% markup on their already inflated prices. They are often located near metro stations for people that wanna go quickly in and out, but just beware that they have just outright stupid pricing.
{% endhint %}

#### Bonus Card

If you do decide to go to AH its highly recommended that you get a bonus card, to avoid carrying around added stuff you can just download the app and get a digital card, you can then just scan the barcode on the app on checkout and you can sometimes get discounts on certain items marked BONUS in the store or added to your Bonus Box in the app.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In the app also checkout the Bonus Box, this is a selection of items which you can apply a minor discount to if you scan with the Bonus Card.
{% endhint %}

#### Bonus Card sharing

{% hint style="danger" %}
While you likely cant get in trouble for using someone else's card if you decide to share your card basically the worst thing that can happen is that the AH deactivates your bonus card.
{% endhint %}

Due to the popularity of AH there is [a community](https://www.reddit.com/r/persoonlijkebonus/) of people that share bonus cards which have special deals. You should just be able to download the images of the barcodes and then scan them at checkout the active whatever deal is activated on the bonus card of the person sharing.

Alternatively if you just forgot your bonus card but you still want some of the deals that just exist within the store then you can just get a plain card barcode from [this website](https://bonuskaart-ah.nl/) or [this website](https://randombonuskaart.nl/) this is a plain bonus card which should at least give you the normal deals in the store.

### Dirk

This is one of the cheaper stores to my knowledge there is no app currently available but they have a [website](https://www.dirk.nl/) which includes various sections on stuff that is currently reduced in pricing, its a really nice location if you are working on a budget. To my knowledge there aren't as many Dirk locations as AH but given the excellent public transport you should have no issue finding one at least somewhat close.

***

### Spar

This is a somewhat similar principle to AH togo, these are usually smaller stores located in places where you quickly drop in and out, **they also have a considerable markup** so just keep that in mind. But they are usually conveniently situated so if you have the budget then they might be a good spot to grab a quick lunch or a drink. Spar also has a [website ](https://www.spar.nl/)and an app.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Just not recommended if you are living on a tighter budget.
{% endhint %}

[App for apple](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/spar-plus/id491909828)

### Lidl

Lidl is also on the cheaper side, it has a more built out tech side with a nice [website ](https://www.lidl.nl/c/lidl-shop/s10008767)which includes offers and product pricing. It also has an app with a costumer card similar to the bonus card from AH.

[App for android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lidl.eci.lidlplus\&hl=nl)

[App for apple](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/lidl-plus/id1238611143)

***

### Jumbo

Jumbo is generally compared to AH in terms of pricing, as usual they have a [website ](https://www.jumbo.com/)and an app. Jumbo similar to Lidl and AH also have also costumer card which you should be able to activate within the app.

[App for android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icemobile.jumboclient\&hl=nl)

[App for apple](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/jumbo/id936150402)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you wanna go to Jumbo vs AH it really depends on the product offerings and the pricing, if you have either equidistant from your home then it doesn't really matter too much which you go to, in general I'd recommend to just look at what they offer and see where you can get it for cheaper or at all.
{% endhint %}

#### Card sharing

Card sharing is also a thing here, for a random card generator checkout [this website](https://randomextrapas.nl/).

### Additional advice and tips

#### Use existing travel routes to you're advantage

A really good strategy, especially if you don't have any grocery stores near you, is to see if there are any on the route to VU or just go to ones near VU, there is an AH XL (very large AH) [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Albert+Heijn+XL/@52.3294215,4.8634529,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x47c60a1196bf3617:0x9077866fdb2ca225!8m2!3d52.3310447!4d4.8778367!16s%2Fg%2F11btm9xqhj?entry=ttu) . There is also one near the metro station Amsterdam Zuid [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Albert+Heijn/@52.3349268,4.8645256,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x47c60a0590942457:0x8c9000c99a63400d!8m2!3d52.3364489!4d4.8719072!16s%2Fg%2F11fylqg\_y1?entry=ttu) which is nice to combine if you go to / come from the station anyways.

{% hint style="info" %}
Also one thing of note is that VU does have a Spar on campus but remember the markup.
{% endhint %}

#### Avoid prepackaged

This applies to basically all grocery stores, they often sell like prepackaged vegetables or like boxes which contain all the stuff for a meal. But most of the time, especially the stuff in plastic bags, has a considerable markup and goes bad _much_ faster. So just buy fresh stuff that ain't precut / prepackaged.

{% hint style="info" %}
The general consensus with alot of people is that you should do most of your shopping at Dirk or Lidl then for maybe the last 10% of your groceries to to AH or Jumbo, and remember to always look at bonuses/discounts if you're on a tight buget.

## Furniture

### IKEA

Kind of an obvious candidate, unless you are staying for a longer amount of time and maybe want some more high quality stuff IKEA is really good for 99% of what you need, they even do deliveries. You can easily kit out an **entire room** with anywhere from like 500 - 1000‚Ç¨&#x20;

***

### WhatsApp groups

One very easy way to get Furniture is to see if there is a group chat for the place you are living. Very often people moving out want to get rid of their furniture and will often sell it for extremely cheap or even just give it away since people rarely take it with them when moving, so its a great opportunity to snag really cheap furniture items.

{% hint style="info" %}
If there is no existing WhatsApp group then I would strongly advise to make one. Its really beneficial to have at least some line of communication with your neighbors, you can just print out and hand a invite code in your hallway.
{% endhint %}

## Appliances

While most places generally come stocked with the required appliances it can sometimes happen that you need something.

### CoolBlue

If you need appliances on a more short term basis or just really don't want to buy them then CoolBlue offers a subscription based service for appliances on [their website](https://www.coolblue.nl/en/subscriptions).
