### Tips and Tricks

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hot Tip #1**

Uni will recommend you Wendy from Expat services. She is a scam.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hot Tip #2**

If it's too good, 99% a scam. ALWAYS ASK FOR A VIEWING AND FLOORPLANS FIRST BEFORE PAYING ANYTHING!!!!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hot Tip #3**

Finding a place to live is a full-time job! Go to viewings! Talk to people! Call around! Expect it to eat up a lot of time in your day.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hot Tip #4**&#x20;

Unless you really have no other option, get a place where you can register. You need a BSN and you need to have your address registered. Your life will be way harder without those things + you'll be forced to pay tourist tax.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hot Tip #5**

During summer, a huge housing bubble forms as everyone and their mother begins searching for a new place to stay. As a result, prices inflate to exorbitant amounts. You may want to wait out this period at home, see what options you have with online uni (or traveling if you're Dutch), and come back around October after the bubble has burst.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hot Tip #6**

Set alarms to receive newly listed rooms/apartments and call/reply ASAP. If you're techy enough, you could probably make a script for it :)
