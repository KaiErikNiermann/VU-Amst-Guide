# üíü Health and Safety

## GP AND MEDICAL NON EMERGENCIES

GPs can usually be easily found on Google Maps. Search ‚Äúhuisarts‚Äù and pick the one closest to you. Their website should have a means of registering. You can also as a VU student register with the VUmc, however this is not a good idea if you live far from campus.

If you have an emergency, which is not life threatening but not bad enough to just be dismissed, call your local GP, even if you are registered there yet or not. If you are out of hours, HPA work for tourists and out of hour emergencies [https://www.huisartsenpostenamsterdam.nl/](https://www.huisartsenpostenamsterdam.nl/) . During working hours, unless you are about to die, you need referral to go to the ED in the hospital. Just remember that so you won‚Äôt get disappointed.

## Alcohol

Although you can easily get carried away during house parties and you can get wasted pretty fast (bacardi is pretty sneaky) it's important to know what to do when you, or your friend becomes unresponsive.

1. Make sure the person is breathing. It is vital to approach the person and ensure that their airway is clear, make them comfortable and lie down _**sideways**_
2. If you or the person is completely unresponsive, it is not easy to detect breathing or a heartbeat and or there is excessive vomiting, _**call 112 ASAP**_. If you are here legally, you are covered by EU medical insurance and _**won't go bankrupt**_ so don't hesitate. It's better to have a call and the operator sending an officer to check on you than being sorry after.

## Spiking

Although uncommon within Amsterdam clubs and festivals, it is possible that you or somebody might get spiked. This is vital to act fast in order to ensure that you or your friend do not have more severe effects after.

### To _prevent_ being spiked

Although this is relatively common sense, go with the motto of "out of sight, out of mind". Meaning that if you lose contact with your drink, and it's not with somebody you trust (and no the guy hooking up with you in the club is not to be trusted) do not attempt to continue the drink, just leave it and go get another one. Alot of clubs will tell you to leave drinks outside bathrooms or outdoor areas, in which case you either leave it with somebody you know or you just kiss it goodbye.

### **To **_**detect**_** spiking**

Use common sense and know everyone's limits. If a person suddenly gets drunk from one long island when they are heavy weight, then keep a close eye on them. Symptoms which don't correlate with being actually drunk are:

1. Muscle spasms. (Hand/eyes/face twitching)
2. Memory loss (can't recall people, or birthday and other distinct memories)
3. Confusion and stress (as in they will panic, or break down)
4. Breathing problems (eg hyperventilating)
5. Spiking substances which utilize MDMA or close, will have the effect of the other person suddenly being overly affectionate, smiling and just give a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù feel. Pay attention to the jaw, as it tends to flex the muscles alot (crooked jaws are a giveaway)

If you do detect these, and you are confident that there is something off (always trust your gut feeling) _**inform as many people as possible**_. Tell the barman, the security guard, the guy collecting glasses or simply the girl next to you. It is vital to start spreading the word as there are certain procedures in place in clubs to quickly remediate this and call for help as soon as possible. It is _**vital**_ to call an ambulance or visit a hospital as toxicology tests can reveal any imminent health concerns.

## Drugs

Amsterdam is famous for weed and hard drugs. If you do decide to take them its important to know how to do so safely.

### Sourcing drugs

For weed, coffee shops are all over the place and usually ok. Just when getting something make sure it's sealed in tubes or bags.

For hard stuff, _**don't accept from street party dealers**_. Only safe thing I can imagine would be loons, but not even that. Ask around your dorm, friends and somebody will plug you in to a trusted and vetted source.

### Bad trips

It is vital to look beforehand what each drug does, and how much to take and a designed trip carer. Most likely your dealer can help you in this too (to advise dosage and preparation).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Never, ever go "omg let's just take a pill/tab/line for the first time"
{% endhint %}

These drugs effect your chemical balance and can hurt you, sometimes permanently and fatally if you don't know what you are doing. However, if did somehow do too much Google how to calm from a bad trip or call 112.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**You can't be arrested or fined from overdosing** **or have taken drugs.** So you are perfectly protected and safe.

## A short tldr is

**Cocaine**

Too much coke usually leads to heart arrhythmia among other things, stop the person from taking more, try to sit them down and feed them alot of water and stay with them

**LSD**

If its bitter **spit it out**. If you take too much then it's a **dangerous situation**. There is no trip escape, except maybe drinking water helps a tiny bit. Sometimes police intervention is needed so be careful and start very low.

**XTC**

You can't really have a bad trip on a good mindset. However, **do not take too much** cause it **might cause permanent damage**. **And don‚Äôt take it if you get anxious easily**. The only issue is the after drop, or what a person might do due to its horny side effects so keep an eye on your friends.

**Shrooms**

That's the safest, bad trip? Eat a shit ton of sugar and then you'll phase out fast.

**Other party drugs**

Consult Google or your dealer or local emergency services

Also, if you want to verify your dealer you can send samples of drugs for free and anonymously at [https://www.drugs-test.nl/en/](https://www.drugs-test.nl/en/) in order to be sure of what you have.

#### Sexual Health

If you have basic dutch health care insurance, and have serious mental problems which need medication to treat, then go to your GP, who will in turn refer you to a mental clinic.&#x20;
